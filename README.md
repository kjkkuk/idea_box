2. Install Postgres DB
3. Install all dependencies:
 ```

Set up DB:

The most interesting task:

To be honest, I can't single out any specific task, many of them seemed useful and interesting to me, such as: working with the "devise" gem, using the "pundit" gem , using Jquery to make something beautiful, database design and creation.

The most difficult task:

While I was developing this project, the most difficult of them was authorization and solve some bugs.

What could I do if I had more time?

First, I would add pictures with storage in aws and implement donates for ideas or teams. In parallel i would create a course on Udemy or Coursera for startups or add courses on or platform for describe how to begin a startup. Maybe open startup-hub by Idea Box and labs in university.
